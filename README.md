# Rogue Renewal

This is a simple roguelike game I'm building around my new game engine, <a href = 'https://github.com/benergize/Game-Boulder'>Game Boulder</a>. This project should showcase the capabilities of the engine. 

Right now you can move around do damage and take damage. Use WASD to move, E to open chests, K to attack. There's no victory or defeat conditions, but this showcases:

<ul>
  <li>The orginization system of the engine/current best practices</li>
  <li>GameObjects</li>
  <li>Sprites/sprite sheets</li>
  <li>Sounds</li>
  <li>Backgrounds</li>
  <li>Tiles</li>
</ul>
